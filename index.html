          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p class="abstract-text">
            <i>Saudade</i> is a virtual reality (VR) psychological horror game 
            designed to elevate player immersion by integrating adaptive 
            artificial intelligence (AI) and meticulously crafted atmospheric design. 
            The in-game experience investigates the boundaries of the horror genre by 
            exploring the psychological tension between the player and an adaptive 
            antagonist. Set in the abandoned and foreboding 
            Saudade Memory Rehabilitation Center, the player 
            must navigate a series of tasks to escape a facility 
            steeped in mystery. As they progress, they uncover the 
            unsettling truth about the facility and 
            the protagonist's connection to it. The 
            narrative unfolds through environmental 
            storytelling and player-driven exploration, 
            immersing the player in an eerie world that feels both alien and 
            disturbingly familiar.

            Central to <i>Saudade</i> is its adaptive antagonistâ€”a figure of 
            horror that dynamically responds and adapts to the player's actions. This 
            AI-driven entity observes the player's behavior, identifies behavior patterns, 
            and develops new strategies to hinder their progress of escape. For instance, 
            if the player frequently uses certain evasive methods or hides in specific 
            locations, the antagonist adapts by altering its patrol routes or how it attacks 
            the player. This constant adaptation heightens the psychological tension of the 
            player experience, as the player cannot rely on predictable adversarial behavior. 
            The relationship between the player and the entity creates an unpredictable and 
            escalating sense of dread. By emphasizing psychological tension over traditional 
            jump scares and exploring the complementary immersive potential of VR and horror, 
            <i>Saudade</i> aims to revolutionize the way players engage with and experience horror. 
            The project serves as a case study in exploring elements of immersion in game design.
