# 'Saudade' - Exploring Immersive Boundaries through Horror Environments and Heuristic-Based AI in VR
 

## Abstract

Saudade is a virtual reality (VR) psychological horror game designed to elevate player immersion by integrating adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) and meticulously crafted atmospheric design. The in-game experience investigates the boundaries of the horror genre by exploring the psychological tension between the player and an adaptive antagonist. Set in the abandoned and foreboding Saudade Memory Rehabilitation Center, the player must navigate a series of tasks to escape a facility steeped in mystery. As they progress, they uncover the unsettling truth about the facility and the protagonist's connection to it. The narrative unfolds through environmental storytelling and player-driven exploration, immersing the player in an eerie world that feels both alien and disturbingly familiar.

Central to Saudade is its adaptive antagonistâ€”a figure of horror that dynamically responds and adapts to the player's actions. This AI-driven entity observes the player's behavior, identifies behavior patterns, and develops new strategies to hinder their progress of escape. For instance, if the player frequently uses certain evasive methods or hides in specific locations, the antagonist adapts by altering its patrol routes or how it attacks the player. This constant adaptation heightens the psychological tension of the player experience, as the player cannot rely on predictable adversarial behavior. The relationship between the player and the entity creates an unpredictable and escalating sense of dread. By emphasizing psychological tension over traditional jump scares and exploring the complementary immersive potential of VR and horror, Saudade aims to revolutionize the way players engage with and experience horror. The project serves as a case study in exploring elements of immersion in game design.
